Now I'd like you to take your thumbs and find the two pointy bones on the front of your body where a belt might go. Once you find them, trace that bone all the way up to its highest point. (Demonstrate the desired position of the arms. RA can do this to their own body as they're talking, so the participant has more guidance.) 2. Once you find the top part of the bone, keep your fingers there while I place the tape measure across your stomach so it's in line with those points. (RA touches the hip area OVER t-shirt to ensure accuracy of location and places tape measure across stomach in line with participant's fingers.) 3. Please cross your arms, and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Think of giving yourself a hug. I'm now going to reach around you to grab the other end of the tape measure, so that I can get a full measurement of your waist. (Extend the measuring tape around the waist. Take the measurement to the nearest 0.1 cm.)",,,,

In either case, estimate how frequently the behavior has occurred over the past year. For example: if you noticed a behavior when your child was 5, and you have noticed it over the past year, mark your answer ""often"" or ""very often - almost constantly"". However, if your child has experienced a behavior during only one isolated period in his/her life, but not outside that period, mark your answer ""never - hardly ever"" or ""sometimes"". Duration: many questions require that a behavior occur for an approximate duration of time (for example, ""several days or more""). The duration given is a minimum duration. If your child usually experiences a behavior for shorter durations, mark the question ""never - hardly ever"" or ""sometimes"". Changeability: what matters is not whether your child can get rid of certain behaviors if he/she has them, but whether these behaviors have occurred at all. So even if your child can get rid of these behaviors, you should mark your answer according to how frequently he/she experiences them. Your job, then, is to rate how frequently your child has experienced a behavior, over the past year, for the duration described in the question. Please read each question carefully, and select your answer next to each question.",,,,

This test for ages 7-85 asks participants to discern whether two side-by-side pictures are the same or not. The items are designed to be simple to most purely measure processing speed. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.
