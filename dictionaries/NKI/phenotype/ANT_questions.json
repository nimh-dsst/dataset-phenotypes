        "LongName": "Alert Effect",
        "Description": "Alert Effect: Alerting is defined as achieving and maintaining and alert state. The alert effect was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time of the double-cue conditions from the mean reaction time of the no-cue conditions."

        "LongName": "OrientingEffect",
        "Description": "Orienting Effect: Orienting is the selection of information from sensory input.  Orienting is manipulated by presenting a cue indicating where in space a person should attend, thereby providing a basis for the person to direct attention to the cued location either overtly by moving the eyes or covertly without eye movement. The orienting effect was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time of the spatial cue conditions from the mean reaction time of the center cue."

    "ANT_03": {
        "LongName": "ConflictEffect",
        "Description": "Conflict Effect: The Conflict Effect assesses executive control through resolving conflict among responses, and is calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time of all congruent flanking conditions, summed across cue types, from the mean reaction time of incongruent flanking conditions."
